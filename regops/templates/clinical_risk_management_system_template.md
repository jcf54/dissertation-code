# Clinical risk management system

<!-- https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/services/clinical-safety/nhs_digital_clinical_risk_management_system_template_1.docx -->

## Introduction

This Clinical Risk Management System (CRMS) outlines the processes to be followed to ensure that all healthcare IT used to support care within the Organisation is developed, implemented and used in as safe manner.
This CRMS provides a framework that promotes the effective risk management, by the Organisation, of potential health IT hazards and operational incidents.

This CRMS compliments existing risk management processes that should be defined in the Organisation’s Risk Management Strategy [provide a reference] and wherever practical, uses existing procedures, processes and governance arrangements.

This CRMS addresses the requirements of DCB0129 [Ref] and DCB0160 [Ref] and follows best practice as promoted by NHS Digital.

This CRMS will be reviewed and maintained in accordance with the Organisation’s policy [provide a reference].

Note – This statement will require evidence to support its claim on behalf of the Organisation. It must be integrated into existing quality assurance and management processes.

## Purpose

The aim of the CRMS is to ensure that all of the Organisational staff involved with the development, implementation and use of healthcare IT systems are aware of the activities that are required to be undertaken to ensure patient safety is improved rather than compromised from the introduction of healthcare IT systems.

The Organisation is required to adhere to National Information standards created and monitored via the Data Coordination Board (DCB) within NHS Information Standards frameworks.

The mechanisms used are approved process Clinical Risk Management System compliance documents.
This Clinical Risk Management System will be reviewed periodically to ensure that:

- changes in working practices are incorporated
- issues identified though an established internal audit programme are addressed
- the safety approach continues to adhere to the requirements of applicable international standards
- the system continues to protect the safety of patients in a complex and changing environment.

## Audience

This document is for the Organisational staff that are involved in ensuring the safety of healthcare IT systems, products or services.

## Scope

This applies to the Organisation and to all subsequent updates or upgrades to systems.  The policy also applies to any local customisations or specific configurations made to a healthcare IT system by the Organisation.

Note - you need to think about this commitment carefully as applying it retrospectively will be a considerable undertaking. There is value in applying the principals to any legacy systems that are perceived to be of higher risk initially in the absence of any other strategy for compliance with these safety standards.

If clarification is required of whether any system falls within scope of this CRMS this should be raised with the nominated Clinical Safety Officer (CSO) for clarification. This nominated person provides clinical and organisational leadership on healthcare IT Patient Safety on behalf of the Organisation.

## Definitions

Note - Also see the Organisation’s Risk Management Strategy [provide a reference].

CSO: Clinical Safety Officer - the person responsible for ensuring that the healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management System is applied to all clinical systems. The Clinical Safety Officer (CSO) for the Organisation is responsible for ensuring the safety of a healthcare IT system through the application of clinical risk management. The Clinical Safety Officer must hold a current registration with an appropriate professional body relevant to their training and experience. They also need to be suitably trained and qualified in risk management or have an understanding in principles of risk and safety as applied to healthcare IT systems. The Clinical Safety Officer ensures that the processes defined by the clinical risk management system are followed.

DCB: Data Coordination Board

Note – Need to add any additional definitions once this document is approved. The DCB safety standards provide all necessary definitions required and will not require any additional authoring beyond a straight copy.

## Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management (CRM) Governance Arrangements

The responsibility for healthcare IT CRM within the Organisation resides with (INSERT DIRECTORATE).

Organisational management of healthcare IT related risks is as per the existing management arrangements as specified in the Organisation’s Risk Management Strategy [provide a reference].

### Clinical Risk Management Team Organisation Chart

Insert as appropriate
The organisation chart provides the overview of resources and personnel involved in clinical risk management for the Organisation.

## Personnel

Roles and responsibilities for the following clinical safety related positions are defined in the appendix.

- Clinical Director for Patient Safety
- Clinical Safety Officer
- Any more?

## Governance

Governance for patient safety within the Organisation is provided through the following forums:  
Clinical Risk and Safety Meetings - Terms of Reference are presented in [provide reference].  
Clinical Risk and Safety Board - Terms of Reference are presented in [provide reference].

## Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management Deliverables

### Clinical Risk Management File

The Organisation will establish a Clinical Risk Management File (CRMF) for each safety related healthcare IT system.  The purpose of the CRMF is to provide a central repository where all safety related information pertaining to the healthcare IT system is stored and controlled.
Note – We would advise that existing use of the Organisations intranet and document management systems or services be reused to provide this “file”.

### Clinical Risk Management Plan

The Organisation will establish a Clinical Risk Management Plan (CRMP) for each safety related healthcare IT system.  The purpose of the CRMP is to identify the clinical risk management activities that are to be undertaken and the phasing of these activities in the project lifecycle.  The CRMP will also identify the resources required to discharge these clinical risk management activities.

Note - where ever practical you should build this into your existing project planning arrangements.

### Hazard Log

The Organisation will establish and maintain a Hazard Log (HL) for each safety related healthcare IT system.  The HL will be controlled and configured in accordance with the Organisation document control / quality management policy [provide a reference].

Note – we are assuming the organisation has one here. Re-use and integrate into existing policies as required, do not create work or effort where it is not necessarily required.

The HL will be made available within the CRMF. The purpose of the HL is to manage the effective resolution and communication of hazard risk within The Organisation.

Note - need to think whether you can utilise your existing risk register to achieve this requirement.

### Clinical Safety Case

The Organisation will establish and develop a Clinical Safety Case (CSC) for each safety related HIT system.

### Clinical Safety Case Report

The Organisation will issue a Clinical Safety Case Report (CSCR) for each safety related healthcare IT system.  The CSCR will be issued to support initial deployment and will be updated during the lifecycle of the healthcare IT system should the safety characteristics change.  The CSCR will be controlled and configured in accordance with the Organisation’s document control policy [provide a reference].   The HL will be made available within the CRMF.

## Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management Activities

### Hazard Identification

The Organisation will conduct hazard identification workshops to identify potential hazards associated with the deployment and use of a healthcare IT system.  The CSO will be responsible for facilitating such workshops and ensuring attendance from appropriate representatives.  Typically, representatives from the following domains will be required:

Note - list relevant departments (it, clinical workstreams service management etc).

The workshops will have minutes taken and a copy stored in the CRMF.  If a healthcare IT solution is deemed not to be safety related then this decision will be formally recorded.  

Note - need to think how the CSO will do this – email to programme manager perhaps, whatever works for the Organisation.

Where any third-party components are used to support the healthcare IT system then they will be considered in the scope of the hazard identification activities and subsequent risk assessment.  Where none are used a positive declaration to this effect will be recorded in the minutes.

All identified hazards will be recorded in the HL.

### Risk Assessment

The Organisation will conduct healthcare IT system risk assessment in accordance with the Risk Management Strategy [provide a reference].

The HL will be updated to capture the risk assessment.

### Risk Evaluation

The Organisation will conduct healthcare IT system risk evaluation in accordance with the Risk Management Strategy [provide a reference].

The HL will be updated to capture the risk evaluation.

### Risk Control

Where the initial risk evaluation is deemed unacceptable, further risk controls will be required.  The Organisation will manage healthcare IT system risk in accordance with the Risk Management Strategy [provide a reference].

Details of the risk control measure and evidence of effective implementation will be captured in the HL.

### Deployment and Ongoing Maintenance

To support clinical safety activities undertaken during any deployment phases of a project or programme of work the following documentation will be required to form a part of the overall approval process:

List any Organisation documentation used to assure and provide go live decisions here. Reference as appropriate.

Note – this includes change management and release configuration.

### Incident Management

Clinical Risk Management activities within the Organisation and the healthcare IT programmes and services offered are completed within the corporate risk management strategy (reference to be provided). As such clinical safety related incidents are dealt with in a similar manner as other incident within the organisational such as financial, reputational, technical and other service impacting categories.
Note – The Organisation need to reference service management policy and procedures here and make sure they reference incidents that impact patient safety with the requirement for CSO assessment if severity dictates.

## Clinical Safety Competence and Training

### Overview

The clinical safety activities described in this Clinical Risk Management System shall be undertaken by competent staff. Suitable training shall be undertaken by staff to maintain and expand their level of competence.

### Competency

All of the staff identified in the organisation chart, shall be sufficiently competent for the roles and task which they are asked to undertake.  Where an individual does not have sufficient experience or knowledge then that person shall be monitored, and his/her work reviewed, by someone who has the necessary competence.  Such supervision shall prevail until it is judged that the individual has amassed the necessary experience to undertake such tasks unsupervised.

In assessing competency, the different functional roles required to fully discharge the obligations of the Clinical Risk Management System, and the necessary skills and knowledge needed for each, shall be considered.
Primary functional roles may include:

- Conducting discrete safety analyses (for example, a HAZOP or FFA) or defining the Hazard Risk Indicators for a particular project.
- Making a valid judgement on the safety tasks, activities and techniques required for a given Health Software Product in order to justify the comprehensiveness and completeness of the safety assessment and produce the safety argument with supporting evidence.
- Assurance of safety assessments and healthcare IT software products. Performance of safety techniques and development of the safety argument for a particular healthcare IT software product must be independent to any assurance activities for the same.
- Improving and refining the overall Clinical Risk Management System, for example, audit, process change, quality.
- Ownership and leadership, for example, ultimate safety accountability, culture change, influencing and strategic direction.

The first test in establishing competency shall be at the interview stage where potential staff shall be assessed against the above representative roles and agreed job descriptions. Thereafter, competence shall be monitored through the organisation’s established appraisal scheme.  Any perceived deficiencies identified during the course of the work or at the appraised stage, especially during probation, shall be addressed immediately, for example, through the assignment of a competent supervisor or the provision of suitable training.
All registered clinicians involved in safety roles shall, as a minimum, have completed an accredited training course.
Note – there may be a need to reference HR policy here.

### Training

As part of the employment process and thereafter through the appraisal scheme, clinical safety personnel will undergo suitable training to develop, maintain or enhance their competency level. Such training can comprise:

- ‘on the job’ training conducted under supervision
- Internal training courses
- Approved external training courses.

All registered clinicians involved in clinical safety roles shall, as a minimum, have completed an accredited training course.
Completion of any safety training shall be recorded by the individual on the annual appraisal form.

## Audits

### Overview

Audits shall be undertaken to ensure that projects are adhering to the defined safety requirements. Such audits will focus on the Clinical Safety Team and third-party suppliers.

### Internal Safety Audits

The Organisation shall undertake regular internal safety audits to ensure that projects undertaken within the organisation are compliant with this Clinical Risk Management System. These audits shall be conducted and recorded in accordance with the internal quality management procedure [provide reference].

The scope of an internal safety audit will be the formal Clinical Risk Management System and the Organisation’s documentation supporting this document.

### Supplier Audits

The Organisation shall undertake regular third-party supplier audits, as a minimum annually, to ensure compliance with their Clinical Risk Management System.  The audit shall focus on the Clinical Risk Management System, the evidence which demonstrates its effective operation and any issues arising from the deployment of the healthcare IT products and services. The basis for the audit shall be DCB0129 [provide reference].

Supplier audits shall be conducted in accordance with the External Safety Audit Procedure [provide reference].

Note - this section is purely dependant on the systems or services produced by The Organisation and the clinical risk profile of third party systems depended upon.
