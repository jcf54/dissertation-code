# RegOps demo

**NOTE**: the pipeline was designed for GitLab, and will not work on GitHub Actions. The pipeline is also designed to run on a private GitLab instance, and may or may not work on SaaS GitLab.

This is my test repository for my final year dissertation project. The goal is to use this in our production applications.

It works by reading docstrings from every file in the `app` directory and pulling out hazard cases. This data is then used to generate a hazard log, which is a requirement for DCB0129 and DCB0160. Additionally, it can pull the initial hazard log entries from `app/crm/initial_hazard_log.yaml`, as to satisfy initial hazard requirements for both DCB0129 and DCB0160.

## Features required (by DCB0129 and DCB0160)

### Implementation

Security, code quality, and application assurance is run on all branches, and checked on merge requests. This ensures that the application meets the set critera at each step in development before it's merged to the main branch and deployed. This meets a key component on the risk management process, in that it ensures that the application is safe at each step in development.

Artifact generation is done only on the main branch, before deployment. This ensures that the artifacts are always up-to-date with the latest version of the application, and that they're always available for auditing.

Using GitLab's CI pipelines allow for the generation of artifacts, as well as the ability to comprehensively review code changes before they're merged while presented with changes in code quality or testing. For example, the reviewer is notified on the merge page if code quality is better or worse, or if testing coverage has increased or decreased. This allows for a more comprehensive review of code changes, and helps to ensure that the application is safe.

### Hazard log

The hazard log is a mechanism for recording ongoing identification and resolution of hazards associated with a specific system in a specific use case. It's a key part to the risk management process and provides the foundation for many of the requirements.

It's designed so that it's tightly integrated with the codebase, so it's very easy for developers to add hazards as development progresses. To add a hazard to the hazard log, very simple add the relevant details in the function/class' docstring. The hazard log is automatically generated from the docstrings in the codebase by the CI pipelines. Enforcing the hazards defined in the docstrings are actually actions should be done through code reviews, and it will ensure that the hazards are mitigated correctly.

### Interpretation of `requirements.txt`

To ensure that all third party libraries are assessed, the `requirements.txt` is parsed for comments. Comments (lines starting with #) are stored and indexed in a dictionary against the library's name. This is then used to generate a report of all third party libraries used along with their defenses (why they were used, why they are safe, etc). This is included in the clinical safety case report as evidence.

### Interpretation of test/code coverage reports

To ensure the application is safe and meets all assurances set, all outcomes from testing tools are stored as artifacts and are parsed by the CI pipeline. This is used to generate evidence that the application is safe and meets all assurances set. This is included in the clinical safety case report as evidence.

- CI pipeline unpredictable returns `fatal: shallow file has changed since we read it`.
